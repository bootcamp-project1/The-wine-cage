# Cage and Wine

This app is meant to pair a wine with a movie of your choice.  You can change the quality of your movie, but will always get a great wine selection, from white,
Red, and Dessert.  If you put in nonsense or something doesn't exist, you will be treated to a great Nic cage film. App is [deployed here](https://bootcamp-project1.github.io/The-wine-cage/).

## Overview

It uses 2 APIs to accomplish this.
We used TheMovieDatabase and the Spoonacular to achieve our goals.

User can input a movie title choice into a textbox.
User can can try to search for an actor, but Nicolas Cage will be all they receive.
User will see a poster of the movie and a photo if available of the wine.  
User will see a list of recent searches so they know what they've searched before.
